Please note that this XML page is a representation of the /events/index page.
Because the /events/index page is paginated you will have a limited number of results.

You can for example ask: /events/index/limit:999.xml to get the 999 first records.

You can also sort the table by using the sort and direction parameters. For example:

/events/index/sort:date/direction:desc.xml

To export all the events at once, with their attributes, use the export functionality.
