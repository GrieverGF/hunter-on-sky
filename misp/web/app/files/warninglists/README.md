# misp-warninglist

misp-warninglists are lists of well-known indicators that can be associated to potential false positives, errors or mistakes.

![Python application](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

The warning lists are integrated in MISP to display an info/warning box at the event and attribute level if such indicators
are available in one of the list. The lists are also used to filter potential false-positive at API level. The list can be globally enabled or disabled in MISP following the practices of the organization. The warning lists
are reused in many other open source projects.

If matching_attributes are not set, the list is matched against any type of attributes.

## type of warning list

- ```string``` (default) - perfect match of a string in the warning list against matching attributes
- ```substring``` - substring matching of a string in the warning list against matching attributes
- ```hostname``` - hostname matching (e.g. domain matching from URL) of a string in the warning list against matching attributes
- ```cidr``` - IP or CDIR block matching in the warning list against matching attributes
- ```regex``` - regex matching of a string matching attributes
