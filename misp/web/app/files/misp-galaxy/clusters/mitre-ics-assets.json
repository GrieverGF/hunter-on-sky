Controllers, sometimes referred to as Remote Terminal Units (RTU) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), are computerized control units that are typically rack or panel mounted with modular processing and interface cards. The units are collocated with the process equipment and interface through input and output modules to the various sensors and controlled devices. Most utilize a programmable logic-based application that provides scanning and writing of data to and from the IO interface modules and communicates with the control system network via various communications methods, including serial and network communications",

Connected to sensors and actuators, PLCs are categorized by the number and type of I/O ports they provide and by their I/O scan rate. \nAn RTU is a special purpose field device that supports SCADA remote stations with both wired and wireless communication capabilities, in order to communicate with the supervisory controller. Wireless radio is leveraged in remote situations where wired communications are not available; typically with field equipment. This role may also be fulfilled by PLCs with radio communication capabilities. The PLC may still be referred to as an RTU in this case."

Currently the following types of HMI are the most common: \nGraphical user interfaces(GUI) accept input via devices such as computer keyboard and mouse and provide articulated graphical output on the computer monitor. \nWeb-based user interfaces accept input and provide output by generating web pages which are transported via the network and viewed by the user using a web browser program. The operations user must be able to control the system and assess the state of the system. Each control system vendor provides a unique look-and-feel to their basic HMI applications. An older, not gender-neutral version of the term is man-machine interface (MMI). \nThe system may expose several user interfaces to serve different kinds of users. User interface screens may be optimized to provide the appropriate information and control interface to operations users, engineering users and management users.",
