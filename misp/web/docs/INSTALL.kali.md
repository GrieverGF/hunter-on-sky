To install MISP on Kali copy paste this in your shell:
```bash
wget -O /tmp/misp-kali.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP/2.4/INSTALL/INSTALL.sh && bash /tmp/misp-kali.sh
```

!!! notice

    The script is tested on a plain vanilla Kali Linux Boot CD and installs quite a few dependencies.
